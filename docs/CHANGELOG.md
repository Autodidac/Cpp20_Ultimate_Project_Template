# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cpp20 Ultimate Project Template will be documented in this file. The format is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Placeholder section for upcoming features and documentation. Populate with bullet points summarising new capabilities.

### Changed
- Describe behavioural changes, refactors, or dependency updates that impact consumers.

### Fixed
- Note bug fixes or build issues resolved in the template scripts or sample modules.

### Removed
- Track features or modules that have been deprecated and removed.

## Versioning strategy
- Releases follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` semantics.
- Increment **MAJOR** when making incompatible API or tooling changes.
- Increment **MINOR** when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner.
- Increment **PATCH** for backward compatible bug fixes or documentation updates.
- Each release entry should include the release date and link to comparison diffs when available.

## Maintenance checklist
- Update the `[Unreleased]` section as changes merge into the main branch.
- When cutting a release, create a new section for the version (e.g., `## [1.2.0] - 2024-05-14`) and reset `[Unreleased]` with placeholders.
- Ensure the README and roadmap reflect any notable changes introduced in the release.
